# M1 Mac for DevOps

## Week 1

- `scp` is a standard unix program which is installed by default and wokrs out of the box
- `file` same as above
- `less` same

#### Flag tool

`./flag_tool` breaks, this has only been compiled for x86 and should be recompiled for arm.
It miraculesly work when recompiling out to the box:

1. cd intro the folder `cd itu-minitwit`
1. Compile the c code `make build`
1. Run the flag_tool again `./flag_tool -h`
